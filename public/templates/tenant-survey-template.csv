Different kinds of data sharing,1,share_annual_estimate,Would you be happy for your annual estimated energy consumption to be shared with your landlord for carbon reporting and their net zero strategy?,yesno,,FALSE,,
Different kinds of data sharing,2,share_annual_to_others,Would you be happy for annual estimated consumption to be shared with other entities who require it for carbon reporting (e.g. lenders or property managers),yesno,,FALSE,,
Different kinds of data sharing,3,monthly_reads_view,"Does your view change for monthly meter reads? (The difference between this and estimated annual consumption is that this is factual and enables landlords to be more accurate in their reporting and be better held accountable). If yes, why?",textarea,,FALSE,,
Different kinds of data sharing,4,half_hourly_view,"Does your view change for half-hourly consumption data? (The difference between this and monthly meter reads is that is can enable landlords to better identify which measures would be suitable for the building, such as solar panels, battery, heat pump, LED lights etc.) If yes, why?",textarea,,FALSE,,
Different kinds of data sharing,5,analytics,Would your view change if it was only the recommendation/ insights shared with the landlord and not the half hourly energy consumption?,yesno,,FALSE,,
Different kinds of data sharing,6,duty_to_share,Many green leases put the onus on you to share energy data with your landlord. Would you prefer your landlord to access energy data independently of you (such as via industry data providers who can automate the process) or that you physically share the data with them yourself?,textarea,,FALSE,,

Potential concerns,2,risks_annual_vs_monthly,How do the risks change between annual estimated consumption and monthly meter reads?,textarea,,FALSE,,
Potential concerns,3,risks_monthly_vs_halfhourly,How do the risks change between monthly meter reads and half hourly consumption data?,textarea,,FALSE,,
Potential concerns,4,sole_trader_aggregation_preference,"If you are a sole trader, would you be happy for your energy consumption to be aggregated with other meters so that your meter could not be individually identified? If yes, do you have a view on what the minimum of additional meters should be? (such as 2, 3, 4 or 5 meters in total in the aggregation).",textarea,,FALSE,,
Potential concerns,5,vulnerable_confidential,Is there any utility data you consider sensitive and why? (Sensitivities can include if children or vulnerable people occupy the buildings and/ or if the usage could potentially reveal a trade secret of a business occupant√ïs activity.),textarea,,FALSE,,
Potential concerns,6,aggregation_preferences,"In relation to sensitive data or if you do not want to share any energy data whatsoever, would you be happy for the energy consumption to be aggregated with other meters so that your meter could not be individually identified? If yes, do you have a view on what the minimum of additional meters should be? (such as 2, 3, 4 or 5 meters in total in the aggregation).",textarea,,FALSE,,
Potential concerns,7,solar,"If you would not allow analytics, such as solar panel recommendations, why not?",textarea,,FALSE,,

Potential concerns,10,alternatives,Is there an alternative to what we have suggested (automated energy data sharing at different levels of granularity) that you think could be better to enable landlords to accurately carbon report and invest in carbon reduction strategies?,textarea,,FALSE,,
Short to mid term impact of data barriers,1,impacts_if_not_available,"In the short to mid term, what environmental or financial impacts do you foresee could happen if meter-level data is not made available to landlords and other carbon reporting entities (such as lenders)?",textarea,,FALSE,,
AOB,1,anything_else,Do you have anything else you would like to add to help us better understand tenant views on data sharing for carbon reporting and net zero strategies?,textarea,,FALSE,,
